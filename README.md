### *Working Title*

> A open-world crime empire builder set across Latin America — where your only advantage is a pilot's license.

---

## Elevator Pitch

Think **GTA meets Schedule 1** — but instead of dealing on street corners, you're running cargo through jungle airstrips, bribing airport officials, and flying under radar to cross borders illegally. You start broke, in debt, and piloting a Cessna 152. You end the game dismantling a cartel from the inside.

The hook is simple: everyone else has muscle, money, or connections. **You have a pilot's license.** The entire game is built around leveraging that one advantage into an empire.

---

## Setting

A stylized but authentic **Latin America**, using real country names, geography, and cultural texture.

- **Starting Region:** Mexico
- **Mid-Game Expansion:** Central America — El Salvador, Guatemala
- **Late-Game Access:** The Caribbean — Cuba, island hops
- **Endgame:** Venezuela, South America

The map unlocks progressively as your operation grows. Early game you're doing short hops within Mexico. International routes open as you build contacts, capital, and the right aircraft.

---

## Core Gameplay Loop

You are a licensed pilot — that's your only edge. Take jobs (legal ones first), build capital, upgrade your aircraft and operation, take on riskier contracts, expand your routes, and eventually become the most connected smuggling operation in the region.

The game rewards **systems thinking** over pure action. Success comes from managing routes, relationships, risk, and overhead — not just shooting your way through problems.

## Progression Arc

### 🟡 Early Game — The Debt
- A scripted failed operation opens the game. A government seizure, a setup, or a lawsuit.
- You owe money. You have almost nothing.
- Starting aircraft: **Cessna 152** — humble, range-limited (~700nm), authentic.
- Legal cargo jobs pay poorly but keep you under the radar while you learn the map and the mechanics.
- Goal: pay off the debt and survive.

### 🟠 Mid Game — Building the Operation
- Debt is cleared. Shadier contracts start paying real money.
- Aircraft upgrades unlock — historically accurate smuggler planes: **Cessna 206**, **Piper Aztec**.
- A **helicopter** becomes available for short-range extractions and tight landing zones.
- Begin bribing airport officials, hiring bodyguards for ground operations.
- International routes open via low-altitude border crossings and planned fuel stops.
- Goal: build infrastructure, reduce vulnerability, expand reach.

### 🔴 Late Game — The Empire
- Refueling contracts unlock for extended range operations.
- Air-drop support available (expensive — a last resort, not a crutch).
- Network of corrupt contacts at key airports across the region.
- Government agencies actively intercepting shipments.
- Rival criminal organizations applying pressure.
- The **Cartel Radio Frequency** opens up real-time high-value jobs for pilots in the air.
- Goal: run a serious operation across multiple countries.

### ⚫ Endgame — The Takedown
- A government agency or DEA-equivalent offers full immunity.
- The deal: use everything you've built to bring down the kingpins above you.
- **Player choice:** accept and dismantle the cartel from within, taking over their operations — or refuse and face the full consequences of every enemy you've made.
- Your empire either becomes legitimate or goes out in flames.

## Standout Mechanics

### 📻 The Cartel Radio Frequency
While manually flying over certain regions, players can tune into a frequency that broadcasts **real-time, time-sensitive jobs**. These are high-paying, only accessible while actively in the air, and create emergent moments that players will talk about. This mechanic directly rewards players who choose to fly manually over fast-travel.

### 🌎 Flying Under the Radar
International border crossings can be done two ways:
- **Legal flight path** — slow, documented, visible to authorities.
- **Low-altitude illegal crossing** — fast, invisible, but no fast travel and no safety net.

Certain missions require illegal crossings. You cannot fast-travel these — you fly them or you don't do them.

### ⚡ Manual vs. Fast Travel
Players who love flying can fly everything manually. Players who don't can set waypoints for legal routes. **Mission flags** mark which jobs require manual flight, preserving the flying experience where it matters most without forcing it on everyone.

### ⚠️ Multi-Layer Threat System
You're not just dodging bullets. Each threat type requires a different response:
- **Cargo thieves** — opportunistic criminals who hit you on the ground.
- **Government seizure** — agencies force you to land and confiscate your goods. Follow-up mission: steal it back from the government facility.
- **Cartel pressure** — as you grow, you step on toes. Organizations want a cut or want you gone.
- **Rival pilots** — other operators competing for the same routes and contacts.

### 💸 Meaningful Overhead
Owning your plane means repairs, maintenance, and legal exposure. Every upgrade has running costs. Air-drops are available as a panic button but expensive enough to hurt. Officials need to be paid regularly. The economy is always in tension — even when you're doing well.

## Aircraft

| Aircraft | Role | Game Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Cessna 152 | Starter plane — short range, low payload | Early game |
| Cessna 206 | Workhorse — better payload, same simplicity | Mid game |
| Piper Aztec | Twin-engine — range and reliability | Mid-Late game |
| Helicopter (TBD) | Short-range extractions, tight LZs | Mid game unlock |

The flight model is **arcade-style** — responsive and fun, not a simulator. Players who want realism get the manual flying experience and the cartel frequency rewards. Players who don't aren't punished.

## Mission Types

| Type | Pay | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legal cargo runs | Low | Low | No heat, good for early game |
| Private charters | Medium | Low | Mostly clean, occasional complications |
| Smuggling runs | High | High | The core illegal loop |
| Border hops | Very High | Very High | Manual flight only, no fast travel |
| Cartel frequency jobs | Highest | Variable | Real-time, manual flight required |
| Government steal-back | Special | High | Recover seized cargo from govt facility |

---

## Progression Systems

- **Aircraft upgrades** — range, payload, reliability
- **Cargo concealment tech** — better hiding methods for illegal goods
- **Weapons** — for when things go sideways on the ground
- **Bribed officials** — unlock airports, reduce seizure risk
- **Bodyguards** — protect cargo on the ground
- **Air-drop contracts** — expensive emergency support
- **Refueling contracts** — extend operational range for long international runs
- **Contact network** — better contracts, better intel, better protection

## Why This Could Be Popular

**The timing is right.** Schedule 1 proved there is a massive, hungry audience for grounded, systems-driven crime games with a strong personal progression loop — it sold millions of copies within weeks of early access. GTA 6 has primed the cultural conversation around open world crime. This game occupies a specific niche **neither of them touches**: the logistics and infrastructure side of crime, with a unique vehicle mechanic at its center.

**The pilot angle is almost entirely unexplored.** Flying games and crime games have barely overlapped outside of GTA's optional aircraft. A game where flight is the *core identity* of the protagonist has a clear hook that's easy to market and easy to understand.

**The LATAM setting is underrepresented.** Despite enormous cultural richness, Latin America rarely gets authentic treatment in mainstream gaming. A game that takes the region seriously — rather than using it as a backdrop for an American protagonist — could build serious regional loyalty and press coverage.

**The risk/reward structure is genuinely novel.** Most crime games are about violence as the primary tool. This game is about logistics, relationships, and using geography as your weapon. That's a different kind of player fantasy that's barely been explored.

---

## Technical

- **Engine:** Unity
- **Perspective:** Third-person open world
- **Map Approach:** Stylized compression of real LATAM geography, streaming/LOD architecture
- **Flight Model:** Custom rigidbody aerodynamics — arcade feel, not sim
- **Scope Strategy:** Mexico first, complete and polished, then expand regionally

---


The scope is ambitious but deliberately staged. Ship Mexico. Expand from there.

*"Your only advantage is that you can fly. Use it."*
